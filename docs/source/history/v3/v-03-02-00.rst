FORCE v. 3.2.0
==============

Release: 08.04.2020

- **FORCE HIGHER LEVEL**

  - in force-higher-level, Continuous Field ImproPhe sub-module: 
  
    included a safety check when attempting to predict a year outside of the DATE_RANGE. Before, this caused a memory error.

  - in force-higher-level, both ImproPhe sub-modules: 
  
    fixed a critical bug when no valid high-res pixel was found in a processing block.
