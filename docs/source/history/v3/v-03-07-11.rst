FORCE v. 3.7.11
===============

Release: 01.07.2023


- **FORCE HLPS**

  - in ``force-higher-level``, TSA sub-module:
    fixed a bug that resulted in incorrect quantiles (STM QXX metrics). 
    This occured when duplicate values existed, which can happen when a kernel filtering method (interpolation) is 
    used to extrapolate values in the off-season where no bracketing observations exist.
