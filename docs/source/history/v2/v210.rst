.. _v210:

FORCE v. 2.1.0
==============

Release: 04.12.2018

- **FORCE L2PS**

  - Bugfix: One line was missing in the parameter file generated by force-parameter-level2. You can now ignore the red comment in the 2.0 User Guide on p. 21.
  - Bugfix: There was a bug in a bugfix introduced in v. 2.0.. When creating datacubes (DO_REPROJ = TRUE and DO_TILE = TRUE), data were consistently missing in some areas at the South-East border of Sentinel-2 MGRS tiles. The occurence of this effect was dependent on the relative location of the MGRS tiles to the upper-left tile in the custom grid system. Should be all OK now.
  - Bugfix: The cloud cover percentage (and similar) in the metadata was not correct for tiles that are located at the intersection of different MGRS/WRS-2 frames. Only the numbers provided in the QAI product were correct. Is now correct for all products.
