force-synthmix
==============

force-synthmix creates synthetically mixed data based on known spectral information that represent pure surface types.
The output can be used as reference or training data.

A :ref:`parameter-file <synthmix-param>` is mandatory for the synthetic mixing.

Usage
^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash
    
    force-synthmix parameter-file

.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 2
