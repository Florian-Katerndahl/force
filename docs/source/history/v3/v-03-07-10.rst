.. _v3710:

FORCE v. 3.7.10
==============

Release: 16.11.2022


- **General**

  - Added a new parameter to L2PS and HLPS to output provenance traces into a designated directory:
    ``DIR_PROVENANCE``. 
    There is still one issue to solve in the future: 
    in HLPS, the provenance table wont be generated if blocks are skipped at the top of the file, e.g. when masks are used.

- **FORCE L1AS**

  - Stefan Ernst improved sanity checks in force-level1-csd.
