Develop version
===============

- **FORCE AUX**

  - new auxilliary program `force-init`.
    This program will create a new project with reasonably named folders that
    can be used as a starting point for a new project with some suggestions 
    on organizing things. 
    Unused folders can be deleted and the naming and structure is a mere suggestion and by no 
    means prescriptive or mandatory.
    This tool is especially meant for beginners.

  .. -- No further changes yet.
