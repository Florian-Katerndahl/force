Level 2 Processing System
=========================

The FORCE Level 2 Processing System (FORCE L2PS) generates harmonized, standardized, geometrically and radiometrically consistent Level 2 products with per-pixel quality information, i.e. Analysis Ready Data (ARD).

For a description of the method, please refer to the :ref:`refs`, especially

L2PS pulls each enqueued Level 1 image and processes it to ARD specification. 
This includes cloud and cloud shadow detection, potentially co-registration, radiometric correction and data cubing.

Each image (box in Figure 1) is processed independently using multiprocessing and optionally multithreading. 
The pipeline is memory resident to minimize input/output (I/O), i.e. input data are read once, and only the final, gridded data products are written to disc.
The data generated with this module are the main input for the :ref:`hlps` component.

FORCE L2PS consists of two main executables:

- for the majority of users, it is recommended to use :ref:`level2-bulk`. 
- some expert users may want to use :ref:`force-core` directly.
