force-pyramid
=============

For faster visualization, pyramids can be generated by using force-pyramid for any cubed data, inclusively `GDAL virtual format <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/vrt.html>`_-files.
Pyramid layers are copies of the original data at reduced resolution. This significantly increases loading and response times for visualization.
However, keep in mind that pyramids consume some disc space.

Usage
^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash
        
     force-pyramid [-hjrl] image [image]*
     
     -h  = show his help
     -j  = number of jobs
           defaults to 'as many as possible'
     -r  = resampling option
           default: nearest
     -l  = levels, comma-separated
           default: 2 4 8 16
