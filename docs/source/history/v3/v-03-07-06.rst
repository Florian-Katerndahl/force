FORCE v. 3.7.6
==============

Release: 14.02.2022

- **General**

  - Landsat 9 support has been implemented for Level 2 and Higher Level Processing.
    
    - Level 2: processing a Landsat 9 image is the same as processing Landsat 8
    - Higher Level: a new sensor tag has been added: ``LND09``

- **FORCE HLPS**

  - in ``force-higher-level``, UDF sub-module:
    Fixed a bug that occured when using long time series.
    An integer overflow occured in the indexing variable when copying data from the 
    C arrays to Python objects.

  - in ``force-higher-level``, feature-based sub-modules:
    Fixed a bug that occured when using many features of the same multiband image.
    Before, there was a 1024 character limitation for reading lines from the parameter file.
    This was now increased to 65536 characters.
    Thanks to Jan Hemmerling for reporting this issue.

  - in ``force-higher-level``, TSA sub-module:
    Daniel Scheffler fixed a bug in MSRre-like indices to prevent truncation.

- **FORCE L2PS**

  - added some new plots to ``force-level2-report`` and fixed the issue of "empty" sensors.


- **FORCE L1AS**

  - Stefan Ernst fixed an issue in ``force-level1-csd`` that coordinates were reversed when using vector geometries as AOI.
    Instead of WFS-querying a remote server, a local copy of the MGRS/WRS-2 grids will be downloaded now.

- **FORCE AUX**

  - ``force-procmask`` was changed to Unix-Stype usage.
