FORCE v. 3.7.7
==============

Release: 03.03.2022

- **FORCE L2PS**

  - Some smaller parts of S2 imagery on the left side of the swath were set to nodata.
    This version improves the angle parsing of the Sentinel-2 metadata.
    Thanks to Fabian Thiel for noting this issue.

- **FORCE AUX**

  - ``force-procmask``: small fix when -d is given

  - ``force-synthmix`` in Docker stopped working at some point due to changes in the Docker base image.
    The python shebang was adapted to account for that.
    Thanks to Fabian Thiel for noting this issue.
