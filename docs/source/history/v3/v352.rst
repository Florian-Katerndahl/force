FORCE v. 3.5.2
==============

Release: 05.10.2020

- **FORCE LEVEL 1 ARCHIVING SYSTEM**

  - Stefan Ernst fixed some issues in force-csd.
    Added check for S2 duplicate scenes. 
    Only the scenes with highest processing baseline and latest processing date is downloaded.
    Check for already downloaded S2 scenes does not rely on scene name column anymore, as old GCS folder names don't represent old file naming convention. 
    Scene name for check is extracted from URL now.
    Added check for length of date string.
    Fixed problem with converting filesize of scenes from bytes to megabytes.
    Fixed rounding of reported data volume (no more changing of locale).
    gsutil does not create log files, check for downloaded data is handled by the script only.
    Files are downloaded following chronological order based on acquisition time.
    -k now saves filtered metadata to level1-datapool folder.

- **FORCE AUX**

  - force-parameter now writes the polar-based phenology parameters into the TSA sekeleton.

- **FORCE L2PS**

  - fixed a "cannot copy" bug when using the water vapor database when correcting Landsat data.
