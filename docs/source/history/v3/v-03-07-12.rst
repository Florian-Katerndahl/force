.. _v3712:

FORCE v. 3.7.12
===============

Release: 09.11.2023


- **FORCE L2PS/HLPS**

  - Ongoing problems with the quantile function were hopefully fixed for good.
    The function still had problems when a large amount of singular values occured.
    Switched over to a GSL implementation, though memory might slightly increase.
