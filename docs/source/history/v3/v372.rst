.. _v372:

FORCE v. 3.7.2
==============

Release: 20.10.2021

- **FORCE L2PS**

  - ESA made major changes in their Sentinel-2 products, which will become effective as of October 26, 2021.
    Specifically, ESA introduced additive scaling factors to convert the DNs to TOA reflectance.
    Older FORCE versions will fail!
    Update to FORCE >= 3.7.2!
    Thanks to Vincent Schut and Patrick Griffiths for the heads-up!

- **General changes**

  - Docker containers will only be published to Docker Hub, if working in the original repository.
    This solves failed GitHub Actions for users that have forked the repository.
    Thanks to Florian Katerndahl for implementing a fix!

- **New Program**

  - There is now a new program ``force-cube-init``, which can generate a ``datacube-definition.prj`` file without needing to process Level 2 data.
