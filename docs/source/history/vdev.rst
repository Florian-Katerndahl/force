Develop version
===============

- **FORCE HLPS**

  - Analogous to Python UDFs, R UDFs can now be used through FORCE. This applies both to
    the TSA and UDF submodules. Three new parameters were added: ``FILE_RSTATS``, ``RSTATS_TYPE``,
    ``OUTPUT_RSP``. At least two functions must be present in the UDF: ``force_rstats_init``, as well as
    ``force_rstats_pixel`` or ``force_rstats_block`` (depending whether ``RSTATS_TYPE`` is set to PIXEL
    or BLOCK). To run PIXEL-type functions, you need to install the ``snow`` and ``snowfall`` packages. 
    To run the FORCE components that are now compiled against the R API (mostly force-higher-level, 
    but also force-qai-inflate), you need to provide two environment variables, i.e.
    ``R_HOME`` and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. You can do it like this:

    - export R_HOME=$(R RHOME)
    - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$R_HOME/lib
    - force-higher-level parameters.prm

    In the pre-built Docker container, everything is pre-configured already.

  - Added a new parameter: ``STREAMING = FALSE`` can disable the streaming strategy of FORCE HLPS.
    When TRUE (previous behaviour, and still the default), FORCE will perform reading, computing and 
    writing at the same time. If FALSE, these operations are done after one another in sequential mode.
    Disabling streaming might be necessary for some UDFs that otherwise produce threading conflicts 
    with the internally used OpenMP functionality. When using R UDFs, FORCE will issue a warning and
    gracefully disable streaming.

  - Added a new parameter: ``PRETTY_PROGRESS``. HLPS  will display progress information on screen. 
    When TRUE (previous behaviour, and still the default), the progress information overwrites itself 
    to produce a pretty displayal. However, this can cause error messages (or printing in UDFs) to be 
    overwritten. If disabled (FALSE), the progress information will be simply be appended  on screen (stdout).
  
  - Removed warning message that no output is produced when using the sampling submodule.
    It is now checked whether the files are actually written and will only warn if 
    no input was detected or if no files were written. 
    The behaviour for all other submodules stays the same.

  - It is now possible to specify the product types that should be used. This is to give the user more freedom
    with respect to data sources to be used. 
    There are two new parameters:
    ``PRODUCT_TYPE_MAIN`` and ``PRODUCT_TYPE_QUALITY``. The main product is usually a reflectance product like ``BOA``.
    When using composites, you may use BAP. This can be anything, but make sure that the string can uniquely 
    identify your product. As an example, do not use ``LEVEL2`` as this will not filter products apropriately.
    Note that the product should contain the bands that are to be expected with the sensor used, e.g. 10 bands 
    when sensor is SEN2A. The quality product type should be a bit flag product like ``QAI``. When using composites, 
    you may use INF. This can be anything, but make sure that the product contains quality bit flags as outputted 
    by FORCE L2PS. As an exception, it is also possible to give ``NULL`` if you don't have any quality masks.
    In this case, FORCE will only be able to filter nodata values, but no other quality flags as defined with ``SCREEN_QAI``.
    Feature requested by Marcel Schwieder and Felix Lobert.

  - In the TSA submodule, it is now possible to disable fitting a monotonic trend within the harmonic model.
    The new parameter ``HARMONIC_TREND = TRUE/FALSE`` was added. Default behaviour (as before) is ``TRUE``.

  - The Level 3 submodule now allows to use the internal scores for determining the best available observation as
    as a weight, i.e., not performing a selection, but a weighted average. This idea is taken from the MAJA WASP 
    approach of Olivier Hagolle. A new parameter ``SELECT = TRUE/FALSE`` was introduced. with ``FALSE`` enabling
    the weighted average. Note that the ``INF`` and ``SCR`` products will not be produced when using this option.

- **FORCE L2PS**

  - force-level2 was refactored. Little has changed for users. The logfiles are more verbose, and 
    log messages generated by ``force-level2`` and by the core process ``force-l2ps`` are more cleary separated. 
    The queue file has got an additional status, wherein unsuccessfully processed images get ``FAIL`` status instead
    of ``DONE``. The wrapper script ``forcel-l2ps_`` was discontinued; ``force-level2`` is now directly 
    calling ``force-l2ps``.


- **FORCE AUX**

  - new auxilliary program `force-info`, which replaces `force` effective immediately.
    The new program has the same functionality, but does not hardcode the available tools.
    Tools that are still missing the ``-i`` option are currently not listed though. This
    still needs to be done.

  - new auxilliary program `force-init`.
    This program will create a new project with reasonably named folders that
    can be used as a starting point for a new project with some suggestions 
    on organizing things. 
    Unused folders can be deleted and the naming and structure is a mere suggestion and by no 
    means prescriptive or mandatory.
    This tool is especially meant for beginners.

  - new auxilliary program `force-datacube-size`.
    This program prints the size of your datacube, per sensor and in total.

  - new auxilliary program `force-hist`.
    This program computes the histogram of image values (can be vrt) and writes a csv table.
    This is intended to be used in a validation workflow.

  - new auxilliary program `force-sample-size`.
    This program computes the required sample size following Olofsson et al. 2013/2014, 
    which should be used to properly validate a classification map.
    This is intended to be used in a validation workflow.

  - new auxilliary program `force-stratified-sample`.
    This program draws a stratified random sample based on a classification map and sample size computations.
    This is intended to be used in a validation workflow.

  - new auxilliary program `force-map-accuracy`.
    This program computes area-adjusted accuracies following Olofsson et al. 2013/2014.
    This is intended to be used in a validation workflow.

  - ``force-tabulate-grid`` has been updated to produce properly named output files.
    The default output file name is ``grid.kml``, created in the current directory, using the ``KML`` format. 
    ``-o`` can override the output file name (including path and extension).
    ``-f`` can override the file format, use the GDAL vector drive short name - thus grid can now be 
    generated in any GDAL vector format. Both need to be given if not using defaults.

  - ``force-tile-extent`` has been updated to common Linux usage with options. Small changes for users are necessary,
    though all the functionality remained the same

  - The CLI help of `force-tile-finder` has been corrected concerning the separator for the coordinates.

- **FORCE L1AS*

  - force-level1-sentinel2 was finally removed after being deprecated for a while now.
    Use force-level1-csd. Contributions to substitute this program using the 
    Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem endpoint are welcome and appreciated!
