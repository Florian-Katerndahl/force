FORCE v. 3.8.01
===============

Release: 20.02.2025


- **FORCE HLPS**

  - Fixed a bug when attempting to use Sentinel-2C/D due to some 
    typos in the sensor enum definition.
    Thanks to Kasia Lewinska for pointing me in this direction.

- **FORCE AUX**

  - Florian Katerndahl added a safety check to ``force-cube``, as well as 
    ``force-tile-extent`` to throw a warning when no features are present 
    in a vector layer. Thanks!
